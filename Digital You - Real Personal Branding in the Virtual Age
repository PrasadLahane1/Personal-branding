The Six Laws of Successful Personal Branding

Everyone has the potential to build a strong and desirable brand.

Your brand is based in authenticityâ€”who you really are.

Although based in authenticity, your brand must position you for what's next.

What others think counts. Your brand is held in the hearts and minds of those around you.

Personal branding means giving value, not taking. It's not about egotism or chest-pounding.

Personal branding is not a onetime event. You change, the work landscape changes. Everything around you changes. Your brand must evolve to remain relevant.
